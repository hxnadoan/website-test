            I take it you're leaving
            This never gets easier for me
            I'll miss how you promised me the world and I believed it
            You give me your reasons
            And they cut me deeper than it seems
            No need to worry 'bout it
            I can stop the bleeding

            Oh, babe, you know
            It happens all the time
            You give your heart to someone
            But they go and change their mind
            Everybody wants somebody
            Needs nobody, anybody

            Used to things falling apart
            Knew how it would end from the start
            But I can't help but chase the feeling

            Oh, but, babe, you know
            It happens all the time
            You give your heart to someone
            But they go and change their mind
            You don't have to stay you know
            If it's all a waste of time
            'Cause I'm used to having no one
            To lay here by my side

            Everybody wants somebody, needs nobody, anybody
            Everybody wants somebody, needs nobody, anybody
            Ooh, you leave me torn in two, ooh
            Ooh, like they always do, ooh
            Everybody wants somebody (somebody)
            Need somebody, anybody (somebody)
            Everybody wants somebody (somebody)
            Need somebody, anybody (somebody)
